The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a common error when using `calc()` with percentages and other units. Specifically, when using percentage values within a `calc()` expression that involves other units, you can encounter unexpected results if you don't pay attention to the order of operations and unit compatibility. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(10px - 50%);` will likely not produce the expected result because `-50%` will be treated as a negative percentage of the containing element's width.
